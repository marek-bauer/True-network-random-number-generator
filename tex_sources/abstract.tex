The purpose of this thesis is to create a simple random number generator, whose outputs meet the requirements of uniformity and independence. The source of entropy for our generator are delay times that arise during transmission of packets over the Internet. We present the results of efficiency and randomness tests of our approach. Randomness is checked using statistical tests that we propose. We compare our approach with three alternatives from the literature.
