abstract="The problem of characterizing the randomness of finite sequences arises in cryptographic applications. The idea of randomness clearly reflects the difficulty of predicting the next digit of a sequence from all the previous ones. The approach taken in this paper is to measure the (linear) unpredictability of a sequence (finite or periodic) by the length of the shortest linear feedback shift register (LFSR) that is able to generate the given sequence. This length is often referred to in the literature as the linear complexity of the sequence. It is shown that the expected linear complexity of a sequence of n independent and uniformly distributed binary random variables is very close to n/2 and, that the variance of the linear complexity is virtually independent of the sequence length, i.e. is virtually a constant! For the practically interesting case of periodically repeating a finite truly random sequence of length 2m or 2mâˆ’1, it is shown that the linear complexity is close to the period length.",

 abstract = {It has been observed that the first pages of a table of common logarithms show more wear than do the last pages, indicating that more used numbers begin with the digit 1 than with the digit 9. A compilation of some 20,000 first digits taken from widely divergent sources shows that there is a logarithmic distribution of first digits when the numbers are composed of four or more digits. An analysis of the numbers from different sources shows that the numbers taken from unrelated subjects, such as a group of newspaper items, show a much better agreement with a logarithmic distribution than do numbers from mathematical tabulations or other formal data. There is here the peculiar fact that numbers that individually are without relationship are, when considered in large groups, in good agreement with a distribution law-hence the name "Anomalous Numbers." A further analysis of the data shows a strong tendency for bodies of numerical data to fall into geometric series. If the series is made up of numbers containing three or more digits the first digits form a logarithmic series. If the numbers contain only single digits the geometric relation still holds but the simple logarithmic relation no longer applies. An equation is given showing the frequencies of first digits in the different orders of numbers 1 to 10, 10 to 100, etc. The equation also gives the frequency of digits in the second, third... place of a multi-digit number, and it is shown that the same law applies to reciprocals. There are many instances showing that the geometric series, or the logarithmic law, has long been recognized as a common phenomenon in factual literature and in the ordinary affairs of life. The wire gauge and drill gauge of the mechanic, the magnitude scale of the astronomer and the sensory response curves of the psychologist are all particular examples of a relationship that seems to extend to all human affairs. The Law of Anomalous Numbers is thus a general probability law of widespread application.},

Then a new statistical derivation of the law in the form of a CLT-like theorem for significant digits is presented. If distributions are selected at random (in any "unbiased" way) and random samples are then taken from each of these distributions, the significant digits of the combined sample will converge to the logarithmic (Benford) distribution. This helps explain and predict the appearance of the significant-digit phenomenon in many different empirical contexts and helps justify its recent application to computer design, mathematical modelling and detection of fraud in accounting data.},
